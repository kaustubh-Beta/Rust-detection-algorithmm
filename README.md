# Rust Detection Algorithm

![Recordit GIF](Images/ezgif.com-gif-maker.gif
) 

The rust detection algorithm uses colour based image processing technique to detect and segment 
the area region of metal affected by rust. I developed this code for my friend who was studying 
the effect of a solution on different metals to preventing rusting.

Using the algorithm it was easy to compare quantitively the nuber of pixels corresponding to
rusted area of metal. Since the arrangement of camera while taking the image is fixed, comparision 
directly in terms of pixels will work well.

>- You can learn some key functions of opencv from this code. 
>- Refer a detailed [Tutorial](Tutorial.md) explaining the [code](Rust_Detection.py).
